Components:

Sensors:

Water Flow Sensors: These sensors measure water flow through pipes and fixtures.
Electricity Usage Sensors: These sensors monitor electrical current and voltage to track electricity consumption.
Environmental Sensors (Optional): For additional context, sensors like temperature and humidity can be included.
Data Processing Unit:

Microcontroller or Single-Board Computer: This unit collects data from the sensors, processes it, and sends it to the central system.
Central System:

Database: Stores historical data on water and electricity consumption.
Data Processing Algorithms: Analyze data to detect anomalies, trends, and patterns.
User Interface: Provides access to data and control features.
User Interface:

Web Application or Mobile App: Allows homeowners to view real-time and historical data, receive alerts, and control devices remotely.
Dashboard: Displays water and electricity consumption in an easy-to-understand format with charts and graphs.
Notifications: Sends alerts to users for water leaks, high electricity usage, or other important events.
Functionality:

Data Collection:

Water Flow Sensors record water usage in different parts of the house.
Electricity Usage Sensors track the power consumption of appliances and devices.
Data Processing:

Algorithms analyze the data to identify trends and anomalies.
Detects water leaks, abnormal electricity usage, or patterns that suggest potential energy savings opportunities.
Alerts and Notifications:

Notifies users of detected issues or opportunities for conservation.
Sends real-time alerts via the user interface or mobile app.
Historical Data:

Stores historical data to provide users with insights into their consumption patterns.
Enables users to track their progress in conserving resources over time.
Remote Control (Optional):

Allows users to remotely control certain devices or systems, such as adjusting thermostats or turning off lights.
Energy Savings Recommendations (Optional):

Provides suggestions to users on how to reduce water and electricity consumption based on their usage patterns.
Remember that creating a working model like this would require expertise in hardware and software development. Additionally, you may need to consider data privacy and security measures, as you will be collecting sensitive information about a household's resource usage
